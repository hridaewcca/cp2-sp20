  Switch
Simulation
  Bottom arm movement is tied to proximity sensor value
  As distance between object and proximity sensor lowers, bottom arm gets closer to the switch
  Once distance is low enough, bottom arm will flick the switch upwards
  Once switch is in upwards position, top arm will be activated to flick it back down

  Stepper motor
Simulation
  If black is in the middle - equal speed on both motors
  If black is on the left - Increase right motor speed, decrease left motor speed
  If black is on the right - Increase left motor speed, decrease right motor speed
  If no black detected - both motors stop
